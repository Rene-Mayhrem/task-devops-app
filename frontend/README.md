# Frontend CRUD Application

This is the frontend part of the DevOps-focused CRUD application built using React. 

## Project Structure

- **src/components**: Contains React components used in the application.
- **src/services**: Contains service files that handle API calls and business logic.
- **src/App.tsx**: The main component that sets up routing and renders the application layout.
- **src/index.tsx**: The entry point for the React application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd devops-crud-app/frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```

   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
